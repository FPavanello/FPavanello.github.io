**Welcome to my personal website!** 

- I am an **applied environmental economist** with main focus on the **economics of adaptation to climate change**. 

- I am a <span style="color:#990000">**postdoctoral researcher**</span> in the [**Center for Energy, Climate, and Resources**](https://www.ifo.de/en/research/ifo-center-for-energy-climate-and-resources) at the [**ifo Institute**](https://www.ifo.de/en).

- I completed my PhD in Economics at the [**University of Bologna**](https://www.unibo.it/it) in July 2024.

- <p align="justify">My <strong>current research</strong> relates to <strong>the impacts of climate change and households' adaptation</strong>, particularly in developing economies. Applying micro-econometric methods, I study: 
  - the <strong>social costs of warmer temperatures</strong> 
  - the <strong>adaptation response</strong> of households
  - the <strong>uneven distribution</strong> of both exposure to extreme heat and access to adaptation 
  - the <strong> (unintended) effects of public policies</strong> on the relationship between socio-economic outcomes and temperature exposure. </p>

- I am also a <span style="color:#990000">**research affiliate**</span> at the [**Euro-Mediterranean Centre on Climate Change**](https://www.cmcc.it/) and at [**Ca' Foscari University of Venice**](https://www.unive.it/).
