Welcome! I am a PhD Student in Economics at [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/it) in the Department of Economics. I am also a Research Affiliated at the [Euro-Mediterranean Centre on Climate Change](https://www.cmcc.it/) and at [Ca' Foscari University of Venice](https://www.unive.it/).

My research relates to the relationship between climate change and householdsâ€™ adaptation strategies. Applying micro-econometric methods, I am currently studying the impact of climate change on the residential electricity demand along both the intensive and extensive margin.

Since 2018 I have been collaborating within the ERC-project [ENERGYA](http://www.energy-a.eu/) of Prof. Enrica De Cian, providing analysis of micro data on energy consumption and adaptation choices in OECD countries as well as in emerging countries.

In my free time, I like travelling, watching football matches and practicing yoga. I love coffee and listening to rock and piano music.
