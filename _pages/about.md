**Welcome to my personal website!** 

- I am an **applied environmental economist** with main focuses on climate change and energy poverty. 

- I am a **4th year PhD Candidate in Economics** at the [**University of Bologna**](https://www.unibo.it/it). 

- I am currently visiting the [**Boston University**](https://www.bu.edu/), hosted by [Ian Sue Wing](https://people.bu.edu/isw/)

- My research relates to the relationship between climate change and householdsâ€™ adaptation strategies. Applying micro-econometric methods, I am currently studying the impact of climate change on the residential electricity demand along both the intensive and extensive margin. 

- I am also a **research affiliate** at the [**Euro-Mediterranean Centre on Climate Change**](https://www.cmcc.it/) and at [**Ca' Foscari University of Venice**](https://www.unive.it/).

- From late 2021 to early 2022 I was a research intern at the Environment Directorate of the **Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)**. Using Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models, I worked on the economic costs of net-zero emissions (NZE) transition by 2050.

- Since 2018 I have been collaborating within the ERC-project [**ENERGYA**](http://www.energy-a.eu/) of Prof. [Enrica De Cian](https://www.unive.it/data/people/5591358/)

- I love coffee, travelling and listening to music (rock, indie and piano).
