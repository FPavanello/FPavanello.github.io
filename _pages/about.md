**Welcome to my personal website!** 

- I am an **applied environmental economist** with main focus on the **economics of adaptation to climate change**. 

- I am an <span style="color:#990000">**Assistant Professor (non-tenure track)**</span> at the [**ifo Institute**](https://www.ifo.de/en) and [**LMU Munich**](https://www.lmu.de/en/), and a <span style="color:#990000">**member**</span> of the [**CESifo Research network**](https://www.cesifo.org/en).

- I completed my PhD in Economics at the [**University of Bologna**](https://www.unibo.it/it) in July 2024. My dissertation was awarded the [Best Doctoral Dissertation Award](https://www.eaere.org/best-european-doctoral-dissertation-award/) from the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists.

- My <strong>current research</strong> relates to <strong>the impacts of climate change and households' adaptation</strong>, particularly in developing economies. Applying micro-econometric methods, I study:
    - the <strong>social costs of warmer temperatures</strong>, especially for health
    - the <strong>adaptation response</strong> of households
    - the <strong>uneven distribution</strong> of both exposure to extreme heat and access to adaptation
    - the <strong>(unintended) effects of public policies</strong> on the relationship between socio-economic outcomes and temperature exposure

- I am also a <span style="color:#990000">**research affiliate**</span> at the [**Euro-Mediterranean Centre on Climate Change**](https://www.cmcc.it/), [**Ca' Foscari University of Venice**](https://www.unive.it/), and the [**RFF-CMCC European Institute on Economics and the Environment**](https://www.eiee.org/).
