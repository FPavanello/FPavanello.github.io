**Welcome to my personal website!** 

- I am an applied environmental economist with main focuses on climate change and energy poverty. 

- I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/it) in the Department of Economics. 

- I am also a Research Affiliate at the [Euro-Mediterranean Centre on Climate Change](https://www.cmcc.it/) and at [Ca' Foscari University of Venice](https://www.unive.it/).

- My research relates to the relationship between climate change and householdsâ€™ adaptation strategies. Applying micro-econometric methods, I am currently studying the impact of climate change on the residential electricity demand along both the intensive and extensive margin. I am also interested into energy inequality, energy poverty and energy transition, particularly in developing countries.

- Since 2018 I have been collaborating within the ERC-project [ENERGYA](http://www.energy-a.eu/) of Prof. [Enrica De Cian](https://www.unive.it/data/people/5591358/), providing analysis of micro data on energy consumption and adaptation choices in OECD countries as well as in emerging countries.

- In my free time, I like travelling and watching football matches. I love coffee and listening to music (rock, indie and piano).
