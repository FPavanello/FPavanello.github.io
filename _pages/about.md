**Welcome to my personal website!** 

- I am an **applied environmental economist** with main focuses on the **economics of adaptation to climate change**. 

- I am a **4th year PhD Candidate in Economics** at the [**University of Bologna**](https://www.unibo.it/it), and **I will be on the 2023/2024 job market**. 

- My **current research** relates to the **relationship between climate change impacts and household adaptation strategies**, particularly in developing economies. Applying micro-econometric methods, I study: 1) the **social costs of climate change**, especially in terms of health impacts; 2) **household adaptation** through residential cooling electricity; 3) the **inequality** in the access to adaptation.

- I am also a **research affiliate** at the [**Euro-Mediterranean Centre on Climate Change**](https://www.cmcc.it/) and at [**Ca' Foscari University of Venice**](https://www.unive.it/).

- You can find my **full CV** [here](https://fpavanello.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
