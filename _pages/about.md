**Welcome to my personal website!** 

- I am an **applied environmental economist** with main focuses on the economics of adaptation to climate change. 

- I am a **4th year PhD Candidate in Economics** at the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/it). **I will be on the 2023/2024 job market**. 

- My **current research** relates to the **relationship between climate change impacts and household adaptation strategies**, particularly in developing economies. Applying micro-econometric methods, I study: 1) the **social costs of climate change**, especially in terms of health impacts; 2) **household adaptation** through residential cooling electricity; 3) the **inequality** in the access to adaptation.

- I am also a **research affiliate** at the [Euro-Mediterranean Centre on Climate Change](https://www.cmcc.it/) and at [Ca' Foscari University of Venice](https://www.unive.it/).

- You can find my **full CV** [here](https://fpavanello.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

- From May to July 2023 I was visiting student at the [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/), hosted by [Ian Sue Wing](https://people.bu.edu/isw/).

- From late 2021 to early 2022 I was a research intern at the Environment Directorate of the **Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)**.

- Since 2018 I have been collaborating within the ERC-project [ENERGYA](http://www.energy-a.eu/) of Prof. [Enrica De Cian](https://www.unive.it/data/people/5591358/)

- I love coffee, travelling and listening to music (rock, indie and piano).
