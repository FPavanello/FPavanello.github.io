- Adaptation to climate change: air-conditioning and the role of remittances. (with E. De Cian, T. Randazzo)  
 \[_R&R_\] [\[Working Paper\]](https://fpavanello.github.io/files/Randazzo_et_al_WP.pdf)
  - <details> 
      <summary>Abstract</summary> Do remittances improve the ability of households to adapt to global warming? We try to answer this question by studying the behaviours of households in Mexico, a country that experiences a large and stable flow of remittances. Using an instrumental variable approach, we find an important role of remittances in the climate adaptation process. Remittances are used for adopting air-conditioning, which is an important cooling device for responding to high temperatures and to maintain thermal comfort at home. We exploit climate and income heterogeneity by showing that large differences exist in the use of remittances for climate adaptation between coastal and inland regions, as well as among different income groups. We conclude by quantifying the overall increase in welfare that households attain by adopting air-conditioning. </details> 

- Reducing Inequality in the Access to Cooling Energy: Evidence from the Residential Electricity Market in India. (with I. Sue Wing)  
 **\[Job Market Paper\]**
  - <details> 
      <summary>Abstract</summary> As temperatures and income increase, household will rely more on air-conditioning to maintain thermal comfort in their dwellings. However, the access to cooling energy is highly unequal, and air-conditioning remain a luxury good in most developing countries. As heat stress harms human well-being, adequate policies are necessary to reduce cooling gaps, and protect the most vulnerable. This work focuses on India, one of the main emerging economies, where the need for space cooling technologies is prominent. First, we show the inequality in the access and use of cooling energy, and how this will develop in the future. We then provide evidence of the benefits of using air-conditioning to deal with thermal distress, and how these are distributed across Indian households. Finally, through a structural model we dispatch which policies might make air-conditioning and its usage more affordable for poorer Indian households. </details>
