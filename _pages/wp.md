## Working Papers

- **Adapting to Heat Extremes with Unequal Access to Cooling: Evidence from India**. (with I. Sue Wing) [\[Slides\]](https://fpavanello.github.io/files/india_slides.pdf)
   - <details> 
      <summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify"> The adoption and use of cooling technologies to maintain indoor thermal comfort is a crucial adaptation to rising temperatures. However, the access to residential cooling is highly unequal; air conditioning, in particular, remains a luxury good in most developing countries, posing a challenge to heat adaptation. This paper sheds lights on this phenomenon, examining the differential technological responses to heat extremes of households. Our empirical results highlight a critical trade-off in heat adaptation. While we find that the expensive air-conditioning proves to be highly effective in reducing temperature-related mortality, its ownership and use remains low, predominantly limited to high-income cities. In contrast, many Indian households, including low-income ones, purchase cheaper evaporative coolers, which we find offering reduced protection against heat stress. We conclude quantifying the welfare gains associated with accessing to these different forms of cooling adaptation. </p></details>

- **Public finance resilience in the transition towards carbon neutrality: Modelling policy instruments in a global net-zero emissions** (with J. Four√©, R. Dellink, E. Lanzi) [\[OECD Working Paper\]](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/public-finance-resilience-in-the-transition-towards-carbon-neutrality_7f3275e0-en)
  - <details>
      <summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify"> This paper presents a detailed economic modelling analysis of public finance in the transition towards carbon neutrality. It outlines results from a Net-Zero Emission Ambition scenario, which reflects the ambition to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissions globally by mid-century, using a broad and regionspecific policy package that combines various policy instruments: carbon pricing, removal of fossil fuel support, regulations in the power sector, and other policies that stimulate investments by firms and households to reduce and decarbonise energy use. The analysis relies on the OECD global computable general equilibrium ENV-Linkages model. Results show that transitioning towards carbon neutrality is feasible when considering economic and fiscal consequences. The scenario achieves carbon neutrality while maintaining continued economic growth, despite a limited negative impact on global GDP and on public revenues. The fiscal effects reflect a tradeoff between instruments that increase public revenues (carbon pricing) or reduce public expenditures (fossil fuel subsidies removal), on the one hand, and more costly instruments (subsidies) and indirect effects (tax base erosion and changes in fiscal and economic structure) on the other hand. </p></details> 
      
## Working in Progress

- **The Impact of Air-conditioning on Residential Electricity Demand across World Countries**. (with E. De Cian, G. Falchetta, Y. Romitti, I. Sue Wing)
  - <details> 
      <summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify"> This paper provides the first global assessment of the energy implications of households' climate change adaptation through air-conditioning. We pool household survey data from 25 countries and employ a discrete-continuous choice econometric framework to simultaneously estimate the adoption and utilisation of air-conditioning. After identifying how individual drivers determine households' adaptation behaviours, we combine the estimated responses with socioeconomic, demographic, and, climate change scenarios available at a high spatial resolution to project future air-conditioning adoption and electricity demand, as well as the contribution of individual determinants. On average, we find that air-conditioning ownership increases households' electricity consumption by 37%, but the effect is highly heterogeneous, and it varies with weather conditions, income levels and across countries, revealing the importance of behaviors, practices, climate, and technologies. Compared to other socioeconomic, demographic, and climatic drivers of electricity demand, air-conditioning has the leading marginal effect, and it can account for a significant share of households' budget. We then show that, especially in developing and emerging countries, age, education, and urbanisation reinforce the positive, long-term effect of income and high temperatures on air-conditioning adoption and electricity demand for space cooling. The overall effect of socio-demographic, economic, and climatic drivers is a net increase in regional and global air-conditioning electricity by 2050. Electricity expenditure for air-conditioning is an important benchmark for tracking a new dimension of energy poverty related to the need of space cooling and our projections points at a new, emerging risk associated with this form of households' adaptation. </p></details>

- **Global gridded scenarios of residential cooling energy to 2050**. (with E. De Cian, G. Falchetta, I. Sue Wing)
  - <details> 
      <summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify"> The interplay of a warming climate and socio-demographic transformations will increasingly boost global heat exposure. Thus, assessing local uptake of energy-intensive appliances for indoor thermal adaptation and its impacts is a crucial policy goal. Here we train statistical models based on multi-country household survey data (n = 530,666) to generate global gridded projections of residential air-conditioning (AC) energy use. Our results indicate that the share of households owning AC could grow from 26% to 36-47% by 2050, implying a surge in the global residential AC electricity sector from 500 TWh/yr. to about 950-1,400 TWh/yr. in 2050. We show that this growth will be highly unequal both within and across countries, regions, and income groups. We estimate 2.5-3.3 billion heat-exposed people will not be able to afford AC in 2050. Our gridded estimates provide the missing input for modelling the impacts of residential AC on decarbonization pathways and health outcomes. </p></details>
