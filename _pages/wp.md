- **Adapting to Heat Extremes with Unequal Access to Cooling: Evidence from India**. (with I. Sue Wing) [**Job Market Paper**] \[[Slides]\](https://fpavanello.github.io/files/india_slides.pdf) 
   - <details> 
      <summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify"> The adoption and use of cooling technologies to maintain indoor thermal comfort is a crucial adaptation to rising temperatures. Nonetheless, the access to residential cooling is highly unequal; air conditioning, in particular, remains a luxury good in most developing countries, posing a challenge to heat adaptation. To address this issue, more affordable alternatives, such as evaporative coolers, have been proposed to bridge the cooling disparity. However, the effectiveness of this solution in protecting against extreme heat remains uncertain. This paper examines this heterogeneous technological response of households to heat extremes, and the consequences for heat-related mortality impacts in India for the period 2014-2019. Our empirical results highlight a critical trade-off in heat adaptation. While we find that the expensive air-conditioning proves to be highly effective in reducing temperature-related mortality, its ownership and use remains low, predominantly limited to high-income cities. In contrast, many Indian households, including low-income ones, purchase cheaper evaporative coolers, which we estimate offer reduced protection against heat stress. We then estimate that in our sample period heat adaptation technologies have avoided 27% of heat-related deaths, generating an annual gross welfare gain of 32 billion dollars. Being six times more widespread evaporative coolers have contributed to two-thirds of these benefits. However, if air conditioners had been as widespread as evaporative coolers, air conditioners alone could have prevented approximately 47% of the heat-related deaths. We conclude showing that subsidising air-conditioning is a cost-effective way to reduce heat-related mortality in India. </p></details>

- **Public finance resilience in the transition towards carbon neutrality: Modelling policy instruments in a global net-zero emissions** (with J. Four√©, R. Dellink, E. Lanzi) [\[OECD Working Paper\]](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/public-finance-resilience-in-the-transition-towards-carbon-neutrality_7f3275e0-en)
  - <details>
      <summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify"> This paper presents a detailed economic modelling analysis of public finance in the transition towards carbon neutrality. It outlines results from a Net-Zero Emission Ambition scenario, which reflects the ambition to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissions globally by mid-century, using a broad and regionspecific policy package that combines various policy instruments: carbon pricing, removal of fossil fuel support, regulations in the power sector, and other policies that stimulate investments by firms and households to reduce and decarbonise energy use. The analysis relies on the OECD global computable general equilibrium ENV-Linkages model. Results show that transitioning towards carbon neutrality is feasible when considering economic and fiscal consequences. The scenario achieves carbon neutrality while maintaining continued economic growth, despite a limited negative impact on global GDP and on public revenues. The fiscal effects reflect a tradeoff between instruments that increase public revenues (carbon pricing) or reduce public expenditures (fossil fuel subsidies removal), on the one hand, and more costly instruments (subsidies) and indirect effects (tax base erosion and changes in fiscal and economic structure) on the other hand. </p></details>

  - <details> 
      <summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify"> This paper provides the first global assessment of the energy implications of households' climate change adaptation through air-conditioning. We pool household survey data from 25 countries and employ a discrete-continuous choice econometric framework to simultaneously estimate the adoption and utilisation of air-conditioning. After identifying how individual drivers determine households' adaptation behaviours, we combine the estimated responses with socioeconomic, demographic, and, climate change scenarios available at a high spatial resolution to project future air-conditioning adoption and electricity demand, as well as the contribution of individual determinants. On average, we find that air-conditioning ownership increases households' electricity consumption by 37%, but the effect is highly heterogeneous, and it varies with weather conditions, income levels and across countries, revealing the importance of behaviors, practices, climate, and technologies. Compared to other socioeconomic, demographic, and climatic drivers of electricity demand, air-conditioning has the leading marginal effect, and it can account for a significant share of households' budget. We then show that, especially in developing and emerging countries, age, education, and urbanisation reinforce the positive, long-term effect of income and high temperatures on air-conditioning adoption and electricity demand for space cooling. The overall effect of socio-demographic, economic, and climatic drivers is a net increase in regional and global air-conditioning electricity by 2050. Electricity expenditure for air-conditioning is an important benchmark for tracking a new dimension of energy poverty related to the need of space cooling and our projections points at a new, emerging risk associated with this form of households' adaptation. </p></details>

- **Inequalities in global residential cooling energy use to 2050**. (with E. De Cian, G. Falchetta, I. Sue Wing) [_Draft available upon request_]
  - <details> 
      <summary>Abstract</summary><p align="justify"> The interplay of a warming climate and socio-demographic transformations will increase global heat exposure. Assessing future use and impacts of energy-intensive appliances for indoor thermal adaptation is therefore a crucial policy goal. Here we train statistical models on multi-country household survey data (n = 480,555) to generate global gridded projections of residential air-conditioning (AC) uptake and use. Our results indicate that the share of households owning AC could grow from 26% to a scenario median of 38% by 2050, implying a doubling of residential AC electricity consumption, to 925 TWh/yr. This growth will be highly unequal both within and across countries and income groups, with significant regressive impacts. Up to 4.5 billion heat-exposed people may lack AC access in 2050. Outcomes will largely depend on socio-economic development and climate change pathways. Our gridded projections can support the modelling of the impacts of residential AC on decarbonization pathways and health outcomes. </p></details>
