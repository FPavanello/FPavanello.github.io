- Adapting to Heat Extremes with Unequal Access to Cooling: Evidence from India. (with I. Sue Wing) 
   - <details> 
      <summary>Abstract</summary> As temperatures and income increase, household will rely more on air-conditioning to maintain thermal comfort in their dwellings. However, the access to cooling energy is highly unequal, and air-conditioning remain a luxury good in most developing countries. As heat stress harms human well-being, adequate policies are necessary to reduce cooling gaps, and protect the most vulnerable. This work focuses on India, one of the main emerging economies, where the need for space cooling technologies is prominent. First, we show the inequality in the access and use of cooling energy, and how this will develop in the future. We then provide evidence of the benefits of using air-conditioning to deal with thermal distress, and how these are distributed across Indian households. Finally, through a structural model we dispatch which policies might make air-conditioning and its usage more affordable for poorer Indian households. </details> 

- The Impact of Air-conditioning on Residential Electricity Demand across World Countries. (with E. De Cian, G. Falchetta, Y. Romitti, I. Sue Wing)
  - <details> 
      <summary>Abstract</summary> This paper provides the first global assessment of the energy implications of the intensive and extensive margin of adaptation through air-conditioning. Pooling household survey data from 25 countries, we employ a discrete-continuous choice econometric framework to simultaneously estimate the adoption and utilisation of air-conditioning. We show that, on average, air conditioning ownership increases households' electricity consumption by 38%, but the  effect is highly heterogeneous across income levels and across countries, revealing the importance of behaviors, practices, climate, and technologies. When contextualising the impact of space cooling with respect to other socio-economic, demographic, and climatic drivers, air-conditioning stands out as the leading determinant of electricity demand, when available. Finally, we combine our estimates with an array of last generation gridded, socio-economic and climate change scenarios to project cooling electricity demand around 2050 and unpack the contribution of individual drivers. The interplay between growing air-conditioning adoption, climate change, disposable income, and social drivers will induce global households' electricity consumption to soar. These results have repercussions on households' expenditure and welfare, environmental pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, and point at unforeseen challenges that need to be seriously addressed by policy. </details>
